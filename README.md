- **MDN with Control Flow**
- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
- **Javascript Funcions**
- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- It is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
- A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
  Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may   include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...) The code to be executed, by the function, is  placed inside curly brackets: {}
- When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
- You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
- **Operators**
- Let x = 5; let y = 2; let z = x + y;
- **Expressions and Operators**
- When assigning to properties, If a variable refers to an object, then the left-hand side of an assignment expression may make assignments to properties of that variable. 
- **Functions** (cont'd)
- Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript.  A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure; a set of staements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.
